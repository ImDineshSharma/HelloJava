# HelloJava
Hello and welcome to this short tutorial of java
i created these tiny apps to understand how could we write programs in java

Our first app is HelloJava.java

this app contains a piece of java code put together to make a computer do something

when its compiled,  it generates a file ending with .class extension

Now, to understand it how does the code work, i explained it in the comments(you will see that when you open the file)

same thing goes for every file

You might want to let me know if something is missing or needs to be improved
just feel free to do so in the comment section
